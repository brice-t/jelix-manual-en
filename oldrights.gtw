Jelix 1.0 had a right management system, jAcl, offering similar features as those in other frameworks. In Jelix 1.1, it is replaced by jAcl2 a more powerful system. However it is kept for backwards compatibility.   

jAcl is structured around drivers. Default driver is a "db" driver (called jAcl.db in following documentation). As you have guessed, jAcl.db stores rights informations in database.

Notice that jAcl is not mandatory for an application. Thus, jAcl is not activated by default in a Jelix application. You have to activate it if one module needs it.
