Out of classic web contents (HTML, XML, and so on), Jelix also supports web services such as AJAX, with JSON or not, or more high level services such as XML-RPC or SOAP (SOAP support will only be enabled in Jelix 1.1).

One of the Jelix strength concerning web services is that you follow exactly the development model of classic content: get a response objet, transmit parameters and Jelix takes care of all what's left. You don't have to dive into protocol format or http headers.

There is only one difference: some web services require a specific entry point (ie you cannot use index.php but have to define a specific one for your web service.
