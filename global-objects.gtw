~~LANG:FR@frman:objets_globaux~~

In previous version of Jelix (<= 1.3), there were some global variables created by Jelix.

===== $gJConfig =====

This object allowed you to access to the configuration of the application. You must now call @@jApp::config()@@ instead.

===== $gJCoord =====

The @@V@$gJCoord@@ was the instance of the @@C@jCoordinator@@ class, created in the entry point. You must now call @@jApp::coord()@@.
